1. C-c C-l (Control-c Control-l) - Load/type-check the current file
    - This is the most common command you'll use
    - It compiles the current buffer and shows errors/warnings
  2. C-c C-x C-c (Control-c Control-x Control-c) - Compile the current file
    - This actually compiles to executable code (if applicable)
    - Less commonly used for library code

  Other Useful Agda Commands in Emacs:

  - C-c C-, - Show goal type and context (when cursor is in a hole {!!})
  - C-c C-. - Show goal type, context, and inferred type
  - C-c C-r - Refine the goal (automatic case split or constructor)
  - C-c C-c - Case split on a variable
  - C-c C-space - Give (fill in the hole with the solution)
  - C-c C-a - Auto (try to automatically solve the goal)
  - C-c C-n - Normalize/evaluate an expression
  - C-c C-d - Show definition/type of identifier

  To Check All Files:

  If you want to check all files in your project, you can:

  1. Open each file and run C-c C-l
  2. Or from the command line:
  agda src/PCA/PCA.agda
  agda src/PCA/PCA-Tutorial.agda
  # etc.

  The most important one to remember is C-c C-l (load) - that's what you'll use most often while developing Agda code!
