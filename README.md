Hi. I would like to work in the lab of Liron Cohen, a Type Theory researcher in the Computer Science department at Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva, Israel. We have
 had a few conversations and it looks good. She gave me a task to do to make sure we are on the same page and 'speak the same language'. She is a computer scientist and 
I was trained as a mathematician and then became a software engineer for 27 years. I want to work in type theory and homotopy type theory. Liron asked me to read the 
paper that is in the root directory. The file with the paper is called evidenced_frames.pdf. The research area we have been thinking about is to take her concept of 
Evidenced Frames which work in the context of Dependent Type Theory and extend/modify it to work in the context of Homotopy Type Theory. What I am thinking is that I 
will totally absorb the information in this paper and then model Evidenced Frames in Agda and aim at extending the code I write to cubical agda in a way that works with 
Homotopy Type theory. I only have 9 days left and obviously I don't need to solve all the problems but what I am hoping to do in the next few days is have a good base of
 code in Agda modelling the concepts in the paper, including Evidenced Frames, Realizability Models, Toposes, Triposes and Partical Combinatory Algebras. From there, I 
will start thinking about what it means to extend these concepts to the Homotopy Type Theory context and maybe sketch out some code for this. Can you start by reading 
the paper evidenced_frames.pdf and then let me know what you think about it and about the plans I laid out?
